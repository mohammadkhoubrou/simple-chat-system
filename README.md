This is a simple chat system including two various scripts. One script for the client end and ofcourse one for the server. As long as both ends of the conversation
are connected to the server and have an ID and the address of the chat room in mind they'll be able to make a connection and enjoy.
Use this code to develope and implement your own ideas on it.
have fun:)
